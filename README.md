# Reiko's Economy Mod

An economy mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 on NeoForge, built for singleplayer and multiplayer alike.

**Status: early development (v0.1.0, Phase 1 of 4).** Bank accounts and the money commands work. Shops, physical cash, ATMs, debit cards and coin-based villager trading are planned next.

## What works now

- **Bank accounts.** Every player gets an account the first time they join, with a configurable starting balance. Accounts are saved with the world and work for offline players.
- **Exact money math.** Amounts use two decimal places and are stored as whole numbers of cents, so balances never drift.
- **Commands** (permission nodes in brackets):

| Command | Who | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/balance` or `/bal` | Everyone `[reikoeconomy.command.balance]` | Shows your balance |
| `/bal <player>` | Everyone `[reikoeconomy.command.balance.others]` | Shows another player's balance |
| `/pay <player> <amount>` | Everyone `[reikoeconomy.command.pay]` | Sends money, e.g. `/pay Steve 12.50`. Works when they're offline |
| `/baltop [page]` | Everyone `[reikoeconomy.command.baltop]` | Richest players, plus the total in all accounts |
| `/eco give\|take\|set <players> <amount>` | Ops `[reikoeconomy.command.admin]` | Changes balances |
| `/eco reset <players>` | Ops `[reikoeconomy.command.admin]` | Resets balances to the starting amount |

Admin commands need op level 2, or cheats turned on in singleplayer. Permission mods can override any node.

## Settings

Each world has its own settings file at `<world>/serverconfig/reikoeconomy-server.toml` (also editable from the Mods screen):

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `currency.symbol` | `$` | Symbol shown with amounts |
| `currency.symbolAfterAmount` | `false` | `100.00 Coins` instead of `$100.00` |
| `accounts.startingBalance` | `100.0` | Money in every new account |
| `commands.baltopPageSize` | `10` | Players per `/baltop` page |

## For other mods

Use `EconomyApi.get()` (in `com.reiko.economy.api`) to read balances and deposit, withdraw or transfer money. Every change fires a cancelable `TransactionEvent.Pre` and a `TransactionEvent.Post` on `NeoForge.EVENT_BUS`. Amounts are `long`s in cents (`1250` = 12.50).

## Building and testing

You need JDK 21. Gradle downloads everything else.

```sh
./gradlew build             # compile, run unit tests, build the jar into build/libs/
./gradlew runClient         # start a dev client with the mod
./gradlew runGameTestServer # run the in-game tests, then exit
```

In IntelliJ IDEA, open the folder as a Gradle project and use the generated run configurations. The first build takes a few minutes while it sets up Minecraft.

The dev server and the game-test server need `eula=true` in `run/eula.txt` (Minecraft's EULA) before they start.
